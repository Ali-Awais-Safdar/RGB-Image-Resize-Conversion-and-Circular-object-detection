# RGB-Image-Resize-Conversion-and-Circular-object-detection

In this assignment, we take a single RGB image and have it resized to desire dimensions, as well as converting it to a gray scale image and later on to a binary image using Numpy.
In this example, Numpy is used to manipulate the values of 3 RGB Channels to convert them to gray scale. This Gray Scaled Image is later on transformed to binary image using the same principles.
In the last task,all Contours are drawn for the image and the circular ones are filtered out and then returned by the function. In this example a picture of coins is used hence it returns the number of coins.
